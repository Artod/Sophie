It is clear we need to focus on getting CLI-elements ready to improve our bot creation workflow.
With that let us now focus on the elements of the Learning Interface:

Suppose we said a sentence which Sophie doesn't understand, but could parse a little bit.
We cover such a case.

Input : I want to pick up pizza on the way to campus.

1) Understanding interface

What you said
--------------
want to pick up - intend to collect a product/service from a location [MAPS_GETSERVICEPRODUCTINTENT]
pizza - product/service to collect                                    [MAPS_SERVICEPRODUCTENTITY]
on the way to - establish a waypoint                                  [MAPS_WAYPOINTINTENT]
campus                                                                [LOCATION_ALTNAMEENTITY]

What I understood
-----------------
want to pick up (intent)
campus (location entity)
Closest match is "I want to pick up flowers near campus"

2) Missing interface

Did I not get an entity correctly?  o flowers o campus [A][D]
Did I not get an intent correctly?  o want to pick up  o on the way to [A][D]
Did I not understand an action correctly?

What did you want me to do?

3) Code interface

1. Find route to campus
2. Get route edges from 1
3. Get destinations from 2
4. For destination in 3:
5.    search nearby (flowers, destination)
6. respond "I found the following" flower "shops".
   respond "Which would you prefer to get from?"
7. listdisplaymultioptions(5)
8. Get options selected from 7
9. Show map with waypoints = 8, src = here, dest = campus
10. End

4) Action store interface
Gotcha!
Which module would you like to save this action under?  ......
What should I call this action? ........
Describe the action. ...........

5. Rule generation interface
I will trigger the action #actionname whenever the following rule is detected:
o entity1
o entity2
o intent1
o intent2

[C] to change requirement
[A] to add
[D] to delete

6. Confirmation interface
Alright got it! Thanks for teaching me! Will do a better job next time.

#Whole interface is heavily dependent upon smart UI creation and IR tools.
