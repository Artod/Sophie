# Main implementation file

# Sophie interacts with this Python file to call the respective actions
# Mapping the various parse lists with actions are done by the main Sophie bot
# This simply contains data for Sophie to load into the core data structures
# It also contains method definitions to be invoked by the core Sophie bot.

# The metadata files contain information which are supplied while building entity, intent and action 
# lists to assist the user while making custom response/action mappings.

# Add data to Sophie here
# Action definitions follow here
# Sophie imports all bots from a botlist dynamically.
# This botlist is updated everytime automatically a new bot is added/discovered to the system.
